    <h2>Founding and Managing Nivaro, a Student-Led Startup</h2>
    <p>October 12, 2023</p>
    
    <p>In the bustling halls of Nivaro LLC, a silent revolution is underway. Here, young minds are not just taught about technology; they are actively shaping it. Nivaro stands as a beacon for teenage tech enthusiasts, providing them with an immersive, hands-on experience that transcends the boundaries of traditional education. However, Nivaro was not always what it is it today, and the path to get to where we are today was very long, and in some cases, very difficult.</p>
    
    <h3>ScholarAI</h3>
    
    <p>Nearly a year ago, my journey into Nivaro began after talking to a close friend, Dylan Ott. He mentioned he was working on a projected named ScholarAI, a ChatGPT wrapper that aided students in their learning using AI. We worked on growing it together, and learned many technical skills along the way, growing it to tens of thousands of users. Initially a website, and later an iOS App, ScholarAI was the first project I had been a part of that had garnered any type of success. When we had finished, we spent our time working on other projects, such as StudySavvy, yet nothing garnered the same success that ScholarAI did. Despite this, we worked on all of our projects under Nivaro LLC, most of which funded by ScholarAI. Thirsty for more, we decided to iterate what we had several times, before turning Nivaro into what it is today.</p>

    <h3>Nivaro Now</h3>
    
    <p>Today, Nivaro has become an accelerator program, helping young students bring their AI ideas to life. Nivaro isn't your typical coding class—the many projects we've worked on (and understanding what makes one successful) has helped us understand that the essence of innovation lies in creativity, and thus, we go beyond the confines of codes and algorithms. From initial idea to project completion, the journey at Nivaro is one of exploration and discovery. We aim to be a place where ideas flow freely, where mistakes are not failures but opportunities to learn. Whether it's creating a personalized AI-infused website using React.js and Node.js or delving into the intricacies of coding a customized Language Learning Model (LLM) every project is a testament to their creativity. As of October of 2023, our first cohort is weeks away from being finished. Nearly a thousand students have entered the program, several of which asking questions in our Discord and most of which taking part in a still in development AI program we are offering.</p>

    <h3>Our Future</h3>
    
    <p>Nivaro's future is looking bright, and we are incredibly excited to see where it goes! With college applications finishing soon, we are planning to tackle several things we've been meaning to do, including the addition of more courses and expanding our reach. One way we plan to do this is through LinkedIn, where me and Dylan have had a lot of success through our posts advertising Nivaro. Another way that getting the word out has been successful is through appearing on the news, from local newspapers to DCNewsNow. In short, I've learned how to manage and grow a business in my time working on Nivaro, and plan to take everything that I've learned to continue expanding our impact.</p>
